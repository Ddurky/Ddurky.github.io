### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was the most challenging lab that I have had. It was testing us on pretty much everything we have learned in this course and putting it into one program. I think It was really amazing to not have a program that just asks a question in the terminal and gives an output. Rather we had a program that creates a gif image which is just out of this world I never would have thought I would be able to create something like this.

* Lab 1
     
     Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because this was the first program that I have ever written in c++  while using the operating system linux.It was very fun to learn all the different commands on linux and learning what they are used for. Also writing my first program in c++ was very cool because I can see how it is better than another language I learned. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2, is one of my favorite labs because I got to understand how the game blackjack works. I also was able to program a game in c++ which is very cool. I liked writing the different functions and algoithms that helped make the game work properly.
